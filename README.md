# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

Tweeter was made during fourth week of Lighthouse Labs web development bootcamp. This app is built upon starter code provided by Lighthouse Labs then build upon to practice my HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, as well as Node, Express and MongoDB back-end skills.
